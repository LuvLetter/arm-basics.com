# ARM architecture : Understand the facts

**Five things to consider before designing a System-on-Chip**

The instruction set architecture (ISA) is the foundation of all chip or System-on-Chip (SoC) products. It is therefore one of the most fundamental design choices you will make. If you are considering using a proprietary ISA, such as ARM, it is critical to understand the key factors you should consider as part of your go-to-market strategy.

## Cost

Proprietary instruction set architectures, such as ARM, have a license fee and currently an ongoing royalty model that can cost tens of milions of dollars. Moreover, the cost of licensing an ARM ISA accounts for at least 1% of all your sales.

## Impossible to improve

The ARM instruction set architecture doesn't allow open-source developers to contribute. This means you are stuck at the mercy of the original vendor and any backdoors it might have. This restriction makes it more difficult for people to trust your chip and prevents the community from bringing improvements to your systems for free.

## Design Assurance

Verification and validation of processor designs can consume 75% of total design time. Having it open source means volunteers can participate in the creation of your design by bringing their unique expertise in the field, for free. This reduces design costs.

## Large, Supportive Ecosystem

It is important an architecture is well supported by a global, mature ecosystem of partners offering a diverse range of software, services and design support. This guarantees market choice, product quality and an optimal time to market. ARM ecosystems have not yet reached this stage of development.

## Security

Cyberthreats mean that robust chip security cannot ever be optional. Proprietary products can be severly insecure, and because they can't benefit from years of scrutiny from open source developers and industry experts, [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)) and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)) can happen to them.
